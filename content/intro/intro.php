<h3>Editor's note</h3>
<p>The Daily Bruin published a three-part series on a UCLA and UC Irvine student service group that travels to Vietnam each year to carry out educational and medical missions.</p>
<p>The on-site reporting was made possible by the Bridget O&rsquo;Brien Scholarship Foundation, now in its fourth year of funding student journalism at UCLA with global reach and local consequence.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s recipients, Sean Greene and Morgan Glier, spent 12 days in Vietnam with the student group Medical, Educational Missions and Outreach, to tell the stories of the volunteers and those they help.</p>
<p>They conducted many interviews in Vietnamese that were translated into English by paid professionals. In line with cultural practices, the reporters accepted meals provided by sources.</p>
<p>Some Vietnamese names and words had to be simplified and so appear without certain accent marks.</p>
<p>The stories and photos are online at <a href="http://vietnam.dailybruin.com">vietnam.dailybruin.com</a> along with multimedia content from the reporters&rsquo; travels in Vietnam.</p>

<h3>About the Bridget O'Brien Scholarship</h3>
<p>Sean Greene and Morgan Glier&rsquo;s reporting for Heart of the Problem was made possible by the Bridget O&rsquo;Brien Scholarship Foundation. The nonprofit organization was established in 2007 in memory of the late 26-year-old O&rsquo;Brien, a photojournalist and former photographer, writer and editor at the Daily Bruin.</p>
<p>While at UCLA, O&rsquo;Brien planned and completed a reporting trip to Nicaragua. Her images and stories were published in the Daily Bruin and USA Today. Each year, the scholarship funds a reporting trip for a team of Daily Bruin reporters.
