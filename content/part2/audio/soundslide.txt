Went to hospital (name?). Split into groups to go to different departments. We were assigned to Cardiac. We met the patients who were sponsored by MEMO, and interviewed their families. Also observed a heart surgery, and met with patients and families in post-op. Post-op was one room with 5 beds, two kids per bed because no other room. Parents and family members performed normal nurse duties because not enough staff available--they changed dressings, took them to the bathroom, fed them, comforted them, took care of them overall. Nurses came in periodically for more medical based procedures (administering medicine). Also met Leanne today, who is the key "middle man" in connecting potential MEMO candidates with MEMO. She meets them on her missions and in her various work, and fills out their application for MEMO help. Once selected, she sticks with families through the whole thing--walks them to the hospital, fills out their paperwork for them, sits with them in waiting rooms, talks to doctors, etc etc.^web.hosp.picn.jpg|Woke up 7am, buses left at 8am. Headed to the hospital again. MEMO gave giant stuffed animals and candy to the two sponsored patients.  The girls fought over them--the little one wanted the bear, and was crying. The older girl finally let her "hug it for awhile" but was planning on taking it home (at end of day, little girl got the bear).  Our group was supposed to be in OT (same as EMT) but got shifted to GI when we got there. No general surgeries going on today, so went to Oncology and spent time in the Chemotherapy room (post-chemo patients). Translator arrived, Sean interviewed the families more. The little one (Hyen?) may be too weak to have the surgery--mother was waiting on more results from the doctor. If the daughter could not have the surgery, they were going to go to a church for the night. The nurses came out and told the mother she could go home, as the results may take a week, and they would contact her. We got in a cab with the family to go to the church, but ended up taking them to the zoo as they both had never been to one.^web.hosp.picy.jpg|Woke up 7am, buses left at 8am. Third day at hospital. Our group was assigned to OT Building B. We changed into scrubs and observed surgeries all morning. Lots of hemorrhoid surgeries, which Dr. Zuy says is due to the Vietnamese diet. Also saw a tumor removed from the uterus/reproductive system, and an ear surgery. Then we went to a Pediatric Cardiac Hospital (the first in Vietnam?) where MEMO gave stuffed animals to the kids.^web.hosp.picw.jpg|Woke up 7am, buses left at 8am. Third day at hospital.

Split into groups to go to different departments. We were assigned to Cardiac. We met the patients who were sponsored by MEMO, and interviewed their families. Also observed a heart surgery, and met with patients and families in post-op. Post-op was one room with 5 beds, two kids per bed because no other room. Parents and family members performed normal nurse duties because not enough staff available--they changed dressings, took them to the bathroom, fed them, comforted them, took care of them overall. Nurses came in periodically for more medical based procedures (administering medicine). Also met Leanne today, who is the key "middle man" in connecting potential MEMO candidates with MEMO. She meets them on her missions and in her various work, and fills out their application for MEMO help. Once selected, she sticks with families through the whole thing--walks them to the hospital, fills out their paperwork for them, sits with them in waiting rooms, talks to doctors, etc etc.^web.hosp.picj.jpg|Woke up 7am, on the buses by 8am.

Headed to the hospital again. MEMO gave giant stuffed animals and candy to the two sponsored patients.  The girls fought over them--the little one wanted the bear, and was crying. The older girl finally let her "hug it for awhile" but was planning on taking it home (at end of day, little girl got the bear).  Our group was supposed to be in OT (same as EMT) but got shifted to GI when we got there. No general surgeries going on today, so went to Oncology and spent time in the Chemotherapy room (post-chemo patients). Translator arrived, Sean interviewed the families more. The little one (Hyen?) may be too weak to have the surgery--mother was waiting on more results from the doctor. If the daughter could not have the surgery, they were going to go to a church for the night. The nurses came out and told the mother she could go home, as the results may take a week, and they would contact her. We got in a cab with the family to go to the church, but ended up taking them to the zoo as they both had never been to one.^web.hosp.picae.jpg|Woke up 7am, buses left at 8am. Third day at hospital.
